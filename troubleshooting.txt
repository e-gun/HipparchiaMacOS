Troubleshooting:

[a] A hard crash of macOS can break the ability of brew to autostart postgresql

Hipparchia will give the following error when you try to launch:

	psycopg2.OperationalError: could not connect to server: Connection refused
		Is the server running on host "127.0.0.1" and accepting
		TCP/IP connections on port 5432?

The problem is that there is a lock that did not get cleared owing to the crash.

Delete the following file:

	/usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid
	
Then you can restart the service:

	brew services restart postgresql
