[HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL / IN PROGRESS]

building HipparchiaServer as a standalone app

you could distribute this to anyone/everyone: no need to install python, flask, etc.

install py2app:

	$ ~/hipparchia_venv/bin/pip3 install py2app

in a COPY of the master distribution:

install 'Hipparchia.py' (which is just a clone of run.py but renamed to give the app the right name)

replace './server/__init__.py' with 'hipparchia2app_server.__init__.py'

build the app:

	$ ~/hipparchia_venv/bin/python hipparchia2app_setup.py py2app

test the app in the terminal:

	$ ./dist/Hipparchia.app/Contents/MacOS/Hipparchia
	
double-click on it to run it



IMPORTANT NOTE / SEVERE LIMITATIONS: 

[1] Q: 	__init__.py was rewritten. why?
	
	
A:	because py2app cannot look inside the 'server' folder properly

	you have to set the template folder and the static folder to somewhere that both
	hipparchia2app_setup.py and __init__.py can use
	
	at the moment we have:
	
		template_folder='/Users/erik/hipparchia_venv/HipparchiaServer2app/dist/Hipparchia.app/Contents/Resources/templates',
		static_folder='/Users/erik/hipparchia_venv/HipparchiaServer2app/dist/Hipparchia.app/Contents/Resources/static'

	but this means that 'Hipparchia.app' CANNOT MOVE from the place where you build it
	
	an obvious solution is to set template_folder='/Applications/Hipparchia.app/Contents/Resources/templates', etc.
	then Hipparchia.app works if and only if it runs from the /Applications folder. Brittle, but...
	
[2] Other problems that remain:

the person who needs HipparchiaServer as a standalone app probably can't install PostgreSQL and/or the data.

[3] there is no feedback in the MacOS UI: the application launches and then is hidden. Again, the person
who needs the app does not know how to force quit, etc.

rumps is the way to get all of this into a menubar app?


IN SHORT: all of this is only one (half-finished) piece of the puzzle...
